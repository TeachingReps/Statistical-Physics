There are a number of real-life systems for which disorder is frozen in, or quenched, as a result of the material preparation. 
A typical example is an alloy with substitution disorder. 
Although in that case we would be interested in a single realization of that disorder (a real material), it may still be useful to consider the average over all possible realizations of such disorder. 
The properties of the different realizations are indeed typically equivalent in the thermodynamic limit. 
We discuss these concepts below in more details.

\section{Definition}
The simplest disordered model is the Random Energy Model (REM), which was introduced by Derrida in 1980. The position of its M = 2N energy levels is quenched, i.e., frozen or fixed,
\EQ{
P(E)=\sqrt{1}{\sqrt{\pi N}}e^{-E^2/N},
}
and their occupancy is set by a Boltzmann probability
\EQ{
\mu_\beta(j)= \frac{1}{Z_N(\beta)}e^{-\beta E_j}, Z_N(\beta) = \sum_{j=1}^{2^N}e^{- \beta E_j}.
}
Studying the REM thus consists of examining a probabilistic object over levels that are themselves probabilistically distributed. 
The REM is a \textbf{disordered model}: the energy is not a deterministic function, but rather a stochastic process. A particular realization of such a process is usually called a \textbf{sample} (or \textbf{instance}). 
Each realization of disorder is a sample, but calculating the properties of a specific sample with finite $N$ is typically very difficult--it corresponds to finding an optimal distribution of a particular instance of a problem. We will instead average over these samples, which we denote $\E(\cdot)$, and is typically a much easier calculation to perform. 
Because a lot of systems have thermodynamic potentials $X$ that self-average, that is, ``concentrate'' as $N$ increases, i.e., for any tolerance $\theta > 0$
\EQ{
\lim_{N\to\infty}\Pr\set{\abs{\frac{X_N}{N}-\frac{\E X_N}{N}} \ge \theta} = 0,
}
this calculation is also meaningful for large systems. Because the concentration is also often exponential in N,

where ?X is a positive constant that may depend on the thermodynamic potential. Because this is the case for the REM, E(XN ) is often a good estimate, even for systems with finite N.
