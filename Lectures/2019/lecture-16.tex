\section{Mixing times}
\begin{defn}
For an irreducible, aperiodic, positive recurrent homogeneous Markov chain $X$ with transition probability matrix $P$ and invariant distribution $\pi$, 
the \textbf{mixing time} is defined as 
\meq{2}{
&t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon) \triangleq \min\set{t \ge 0: d(t) = \max_{x \in \sX^N}\norm{P^t(x, \cdot)- \pi(\cdot)}_{\text{TV}} \le \epsilon},&&\text{ and } t_{\text{mix}} \triangleq t_{\text{mix}}(1/4).
}
\end{defn}
We can write the following relation 
\EQ{
d(\ell t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon)) \le \bar{d}(\ell t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon)) \le \bar{d}( t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon))^\ell \le 2^\ell d(t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon))^\ell \le (2\epsilon)^\ell. 
}
For $\epsilon = 1/4$, since $d$ is a non-increasing function, %and $d(t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon)) \le \epsilon$, 
we can write 
\meq{2}{
&d(\ell t_{\text{mix}}) \le 2^{-\ell} = \epsilon, && t_{\text{mix}}(\epsilon) \le \left\lceil\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right\rceil t_{\text{mix}}.
}

Often one if interested in computing the mean of some observable $\cO: \sX^N \to \R$, 
rather than finding a configuration with the equilibrium distribution. 
Of course, since 
\EQ{
\E \cO(X) = \sum_{x \in \sX^N}\cO(x)\pi(x) = \lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{1}{t}\sum_{s=1}^t\cO(X_s), 
}
mean observable can be computed by averaging over configurations generated by the equilibrium distribution. 
Suppose $X_0 \sim \pi$, then how many steps are needed to reach close to $\E X_s$? 
In practice, we don't know $\pi$ and we can reach $\epsilon$ close to it by $P^t(x,\cdot)$ in $\left\lceil\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right\rceil t_{\text{mix}}$ steps for any initial configuration $x$.  
We estimate mean of the observable by empirical estimate 
\EQ{
\bar{\cO}_t = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{s=0}^{t-1}\cO_s.
}
We can check that the mean of this estimate is $\inner{\bar{\cO}_t}{} = \E\cO(X)$ and the variance is $\Var{\cO_t} = $
